My partner and I have recently found ourselves in different cities/countries due to work/study commitments, and we're trying to figure out the best ways to maintain our relationship despite the distance.\n\nIf any of you have experience with long-distance relationships, I'd love to hear your tips and insights. Specifically, I'm curious about:\n\nCommunication: How do you keep the communication flowing and meaningful? Any tools or methods that have worked well for you?\n\nTrust and Security: How do you build and maintain trust when you're not physically together?\n\nQuality Time: What are some creative ways to spend quality time together despite the distance?\n\nManaging Expectations: How do you manage expectations and deal with the challenges that come with being apart?\n\nAny advice, personal stories, or resources you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance for your help!\n\nBest regards,",
